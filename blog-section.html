                        <p>"Nablian falls is a place were you can relax.  A cold water and surrounded by the trees which gives us fresh air. We travel their by car and it takes us 20 minutes from Poblacion, Ibajay, Aklan up to the barangay Monlaque where the Nablian Cold Spring is located. Then walk going to the river, there's a flaglets that will lead you to the right path it takes us 2 to 3 minutes then we crossed the river for about 2 to 3 minutes also. After crossing the river you will walk again about 3 minutes before you arrived to the falls. The ride, walk and crossing the river is worth it because of the great scenery you will experience, clear water and calming vibes."</p>

                        <p>"Our experience in Nablian Cold Spring is amazing! First, we travel by using our motorcycle it takes us almost 30 minutes to get to the covered court where we log in and pay our entrance fee which is 10 pesos, after that some locals guide us to cross the river and to get to the falls. It amaze me, I love how the place has it's natural features, from the river, the rock formations and the falls itself. The water that falls perfectly into the rocks and its sounds gives a peaceful vibe. Also, the people there is very kind and will welcome you with a smile on their face. 
I really love nature and this Nablian didnt fail me."</p>

                        <p>"Nablian Cold Spring offers a truly unique and refreshing experience, 
                             one that’s slowly but surely gaining popularity for its 
                             adventure theme charm. The journey to the spring is as memorable as the destination itself, with the highlight being a river crossing that adds an 
                             exciting twist to the adventure. Feeling the gentle yet mild current against your thighs and the icy cold water surrounding  you creates an excitement that’s hard to miss.  
                            When my friends and I visited, it was an especially hot day, which made the experience even more rewarding. Crossing the river was a bit challenging, but every step was worth it. The touch of cool water instantly revived us, making us forget how tired we were. If you're looking for something new and out of the ordinary, Nablian Cold Spring promises an adventure you won’t forget."</p>
