                        Nablian Cold Spring </b> is known for it's clear water and falls. It's located in baranggay Monlaque, Ibajay, Aklan. The word "Nablian" came from a local stories that says, one time there was a group of farmers that passed by in the said place, one farmer accidentally fall and got injured where in bisaya/akeanon injured means nabalian. From that day the place has been called Nablian.
                        <br /> <br /> Nablian started because of locals who decided to go swimming in the falls because they were bored due to the pandemic. Because of those who got there and share their experiences by posting pictures and videos on social media, many got curious and want to go their as well.
                        As officials and locals realize that Nablian is starting to boom and many visitors go their, with the help of some kids, teenagers and adults who lives there, they started to develop the said falls, they created a medium box that serves as the pool.
                        The only foreign visitors they have had since it opened to the public is Koreans. Koreans came along from Boracay to experience the place.
